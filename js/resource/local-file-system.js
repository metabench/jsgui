	//  could use RESTful interface for this.
	//  it will be nice if these resources are generally RESTful, but the commands make sense as well
	//  because some things are not so well represented as RESTful.

	// http requests could be directed to the local file system resource.
	//  Not sure about directly connecting the resource to the web, it may be that there is a
	//  Resource-Web-Connector that does this. There could be an HTML interface, but the JSON interface should
	//  probably be done first (and be used by client-side HTML).

	// Resource-JSON-Publisher
	//  Publishes a resource over the web.
	//   (is a resource itself?)
	//    accessed from the resource pool possibly?
	//  Would handle JSON get requests etc, and route them to the resourc.
	//   It could be part of the server.
	//    There could be just one of them that interfaces with all resources.
	//     There would be more flexibility in having them interchangable.

	// Resources could themselves take JSON?
	//  With some of them needing a connector?

	// It may make for less repetitive code if the resources don't handle JSON, but there is something
	//  general that serves JSON requests for the resources.

		//  Can also have paths within this resource.
		//  Should not need to get loads of resources to get access to a nested one.

		// I think the file system will allow access to multiple paths - but will treat files and folders as resources.

		// Be able to get, and interact with nested resources.
		//  So there will be a root directory
		//  And resources within that.
		//   Directories will also be identifyable by their full paths.
		//    This may mean scanning through the directories, navigating as resources.
		//     Or the Local_File_System can reveal various things as resource.

		// Also not sure about givine each resource a unique ID to identify it, rather than in terms of other resources.
		//  it may make sense, but resources could still work through paths.
		// IDs would likely speed things up.
		//  Could also help with retieval / storage of resource data, or metadata.

		// The resource IDs apply for the moment within the server.
		//  However, each server will have its own id.
		//  Will have indexes of globally unique IDs. Will also have server IDs.
		// The same resource globally could be stored as different copies on different machines.


		// Navigating the whole file system...
		//  Resources will make subresources available.
		//   There could be a large number of them...
		// Making absolutely any file available through this interface... should be OK if you have the permission for it.

		// Could allow access to the whole file system on the server to anyone with the right permissions for it.

		// And could make the file system resource take a root path.
		//  This could be the part of the app.
		//  A server should not need to always give access to all files on the computer - but it will be
		//   a useful tool for administering the server.

			//  'root' value here.

			// Will be possible to access a file through this file system resource.
			//  /admin/files

			// However much of the time this will be used to provide access to the site rather than to the whole server.

			// Being able to represent specific files with unique keys makes sense, but should be done carefully.

			// Making the access rights system seems quite important for this - viewing the whole server should be restricted to
			//  those with a 'server_admin' role.

			// So, making the server a resource may make sense. As a resource it will plug into the permissions system.
