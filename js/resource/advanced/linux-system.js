// Want it to deal with the USB info.


// get /usb
//  returns data on the usb devices
// set /task/usb/4/reset
//  seems like a fairly simple way of doing it.

// We have a Task resource which we set.
//  The Task resource would be a subresource of these published server resources.
//   The Task resource would fit function calls into get, set, on, off.




// get /net
//  data on network devices
