	// Need to clarify how collections and data objects pass / bubble events, and which are considered parents.
	
	// Backbone may have a simpler and more performant system where all events are delegated quickly to one place.
	//  Is 'containers' a better word.
	//  Each Data_Object and Collection can generate a new id that is totally specific to them.
	//   They could be put in a large index, quickly found with that identity.
	//   The identities would make string keys too.
	//    So when we have all the parents in a map we could access them quickly.
	//    The container may not have any identifying features for a string key otherwise.
	//     An item is in multiple containers.
	//      Those containers are stored in an optimized collection. Have string keys.
	//      Can add, remove, etc those parent containers.
	//      Can quickly test if something is in that parent containers collection.
	
	// Ensuring every Data_Object and Collection has an _id makes a fair bit of sense.
	//   Call it _id for the moment, don't want it conflicting with other things.
	//   Perhaps id could be initialized lazily rather than on construction.
	//    That could be an option though. Lazy IDs result in fewer being created.
	
	// There will be different event bubbling methods.
	//  Sometimes things will be known to be parents or containers.
	
	// Good example with an abstract postgres database.
	
	// We have a table, which is an object in the schema.
	// However, it is also an object in a select statement.
	
	// Maybe will not be so hard to keep track of multiple parent items.
	//  Just need to know we are doing it and use the API correctly to modify the collections.
	
	
	// A Data_Object could contain properties too.
	//  These properties could be collections
	// Changing a property - gets logged.
	// Changing something within a property - maybe that change needs to be passed up a chain.
	
	// And tof with data_objects and collections?
	//  should return those values, I think.
	// They may have a __type property?
	// 
	
	
	//  Controls have been doing that anyway, it could be brought into controls.
