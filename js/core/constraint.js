	// Data Types are also similar to constraints.

	//  For the moment, I want to constinue to develop the Constraints system.
	//   They will be using something similar to Data_Type specifications for putting together the more compliacted constraints.
	
	// For the moment, these constraints will be used in preparation of mapping to a database (not nested, so far)
	//  At a later stage they will then be adapted further for the nested requirements of HTML correction and interpretation.
	
	// Perhaps the constraints, like for RGB, would be useful when putting things in a DB.
	//  Not sure how much of the translation would be done in the DB layer, but it could be done in JavaScript, with the database accepting
	//   less flexible data.
	
	// However, more flexibility and polymorphism in the database could be developed.
	//  We already have a bit, but it's not parsing RGB values. Not that keen on getting into the SQL coding, but there could
	//   be various functions that are made, library functions, that get put in.
	
	
	// I also think the whole system could run as a JavaScript file, but also have a huge declarative JSON section when a large application is running on the
	//  server.
	//  Not sure.
	
	// For the moment, this will be unifying what has been done on Data_Objects and nested objects, and serving as a general basis
	//  for RDB and other DB abstractions, and schemas.
	// Could be very useful for validating XML schemas, for example.
	
	// Some constraints that apply to collections may not apply to database tables.
	//  An example is if a collection needs to have 1 or more element. In a DB there can be an empty table, but some collections may specify it needs
	//   one or more object to be valid (but not to exist, necessarily?)
	
	// Getting these working, then mapping over to databases is quite a bit of code.
	//  Will be a useful basis for translating to abstract RBB
	
	// I think an abstract RDB set of classes would be quite useful.
	
	// Postgres RDB classes could inherit from many of them, for example.
	
	// There would also be a function to translate from generic RDB classes to Postgres ones.
	//  And to translate back too.
	
	// Then the Postgres classes are used to generate code, and functions that manipulate those tables / objects in the DB, which generate code
	
	// Advanced ORM is one of the things that this system really needs. It's going to be obtaining data and data models from other systems.
	//  Possibly would be run to quickly interoperate / import and export data to / from existing systems.
	// Could possibly have extra (very user friendly) modules operating over a legacy database application.
	//  Could do very specific things, as required for new functionality. Would then be in a position for the jsgui/metabench system
	//  to be fully activated and replace a legacy system, either keeping the existing database, or having exported and mirrored everything,
	//   could switch to Mongo or other DB designed by / using the application, or continue mirroring changes.
	
	// The whole middleware side of things will make integration tasks very quick.
	//  The Resource system and interface will be used for much of this.
	
	
	
	
	// Constraints could apply to various different things.
	//  Generally they will apply to a value.
	//  They will be testable against values to see where those values do or do not comply with the constraints.
	//  Not sure if it would be worth using this system to test against XML schemas. It could make sense. Perhaps the system for testing the XML
	//   schemas would be using this, perhaps it would even directly be this but with the correct options set.
	
	// This could get quite large, so this will really be a core constraint tester.
	//  It will be part of the core, but not the essentials. They will be useful for other programs in various places, and will be really small when
	//  compressed. In this case, I'll have a larger core. There will be builds / distributions available for clients.
	// Some will have client-side shims built in, like an IE6-7 build perhaps.
