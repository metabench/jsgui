// Used to represent a database.
//  Want a class for a domain model as well.

// Domain model gets created, then that gets used to create database models.
//  Possibly domain model -> Abstract RDB -> Abstract Postgres

// I think a user interface to specify the domain model would help a lot...

//  The ORM project seems big, it may be best to put that on hold for the moment.

// Get the more basic service / platform set up, it can specifically use Postgres / Mongo / whatever.

// Naming of them... they won't exactly be THE classes to do this, but maybe earlier versions.
//  Name them sensibly and then replace in the future.

    // This could be used on the client too.

    // Likely to shift to DataObject...
    //  May have possibilities with tracking changes better.
    //  If an object gets changed within the DataObject it may work well for MVC patterns.
    //  Maybe in an editing application on the client could track that change on the client, and send it as an update to the server.

    // Or would deal with the columns in a db as a collection better.
    //  And when a column gets added or removed in the abstract model, other programmatic items such as generators could be told.
    //  So that functions that refer to that column could get changed too.


    // OK... think Abstract would be much improved through the use of DataObject.
    //  Have a DB, want to set a schema.
    //  Could use an 'ensure' function.

    // 25/02/11 Probably does not need so much more code right now.
    //  Could perhaps benefit from different ways of storing collections of things.
    //  Like the list of tables, stored as a collection.
    //  These collections should provide more convenient indexing.
    //   Also, a generator system would be able to listen for events from these collections and objects within them.


    // Postgres could have a different abstract model to many databases?
    //  Schema being like a database but things can get shared between schemas within the same database.
    //  Don't really want to restrict it too much.

    // Could maybe translate an abstract DB to a Postgres schema.


    // And then an abstract database translating to an abstract relational database.
    //  The db is like the rdb except the link tables are not defined.
    //  The relationships, such as one-to-many etc do get defined.
    // Editing this with UML in the browser would be very good.

    // Edit UML in a nice GUI, get the SQL code that is used to set up that databases in a number of different languages.
    //  Possibly automatically deploy it to cloud services.


    // For the moment, need to write code! on the execution path as well.
    //  I do like how resources are turning out so far.

    // I think more should be done on the database / abstract database system first.

    // An abstract wrapper around Postgres?
    // Or deal just with an abstract (probably advanced) database, and have it then translated to Postgres?
    //  I prefer making the abstract db, then generating the abstract RDB, then abstract Postgres DB, then persisting that, while still being able to
    //   use the original abstractions (which could be quite simple).

    // Once this has been done, more functionality such as authentication providers should be made.
    //  These will make use of the database abstraction layers so that they will focus on the logic, but also definitions of the logic that get given
    //   to the database abstration layers for them to implement and provide.
