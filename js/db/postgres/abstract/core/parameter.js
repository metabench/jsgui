            // These parameters will likely get more properties to match the information_schema.
            //  Will provider a simpler API than information_schema though.

            //this.name = spec.name;

            //  This property will probably be made to follow the Postgres data type.
            //   Will have more about data correction in an automatic way with Data_Object.
            // These parameters will be looked at, perhaps indexed. Will be used in code analysis.

            // Also want to be able to call the functions found in the database quite soon,
            //  but a bit of analysis on the functions will help determine that the right ones are being called.
            // More code on the bridge, and then things will work very smoothly.

            // Also want to make permissions part of the DB from the abstract web db.
            //  Function analysis should also understand permissions.

            // This will be able to set up and use web databases very quickly.

            // Want it so that parameters are used correctly when creating rows.
            // Would also be able to use language to identify what functions do, functions called create_[item_name] being relatively obvious.
            //  After this, calling the functions won't be so difficult, should be quite easy to do from JavaScript and therefore the web.

            // Then dealing with permissions will be put into the database / database design.
            //  This won't be integral to abstract-postgres (or parsing)
            //  Will be a major part of the abstract-web-db-postgres system.
            // May get permissions / general objects to follow a specific pattern accross databases.

            // Object ownership - each documents object is owned by a user or group (owner)
            //  Users and Groups each have their OwnerID, as they are Owners.
            // May involve a few tables and functions to get working, but then will have a general system for assigning ownership.
            //  Superuser will have override.
            //  Ownership changes can be rejected too (but they are deemed to be acceptable if they were requested rather than given)
            // Group ownership - what that means in particular depends on the group's rules.
            //  Maybe only the group admins can make ownership changes.
            //  Group mechanics can be explored further once the individual users system is working.
            //  Keep track of which users are members of which groups. Also which roles they perform within the group.
            //   That is fairly important so that a normal user of the site could be an / the administrator of a group.
            // A new table of roles for each group?
            //  So that a group could have a 'Games Master' role that gets defined.
            //  Or 'Recycling Manager'
            // Group has some default roles anyway, 'administrator' and 'member'
            //  Could work with them, but also have
            //  Group_Additional_Roles  id, name

            // When all that is done, object ownership could be established for various pieces of content on the website.
            //  Will provide a useful basis for recording permissions
            //  The owner has almost full permissions
            //  The owner can assign permissions to other owners (users and groups)
            //   When an operation is attempted, the system checks to see if its done by the owner
            //    Or if they have any specific permissions
            //    Or if they are a member of a group that has permission
            //   Will be a few lookups of indexed records.

            // Then, a huge amount more could be done on the front-end, using a relatively simple but versitile API.
            //  A file manager, and all the management tools that are needed for content on a website.
            //  The XML editor tool could progress more rapidly when there are actually XML / HTML files to edit.
            //   It could also be very useful for editing small pieces of content.

            // These things will all work very well when they are using the right components.
            //  It will all work seemlessly and provide an interface for administering a server/servers
            // Services on the servers will be exposed through the Resource interface.
            // Things will be done within an abstraction, not all that much code will be needed.
            //  Won't be massively difficult.
            //  Want the website up before too long... need to get these various things working.

            // Loading parameters from information_schema is that thing.
            //  After that, a bit of function analysis
            //  Perhaps parsing of functions.
            //   Then more advanced function analysis
            //  Finding the functions that add rows seems important.
            //  Query the (abstract) DB to get, for each table, the function that adds a row
            //   All of the functions that add a row, including functions that have a shortcut using a lookup.
            //   Also want to get the shortcut / overloaded generated functions working using the lookup.
            //    Will make programming a bit more convenient to have these, and will be useful to have the option of creating them in the middleware.

            // Will be able to call Postgres functions from the web interface without too much difficulty.
            //  Will be very nice to have solid GUI tools built that make use of the back-end.
            //  More options for storing and modifying the presentation layer.
            // I think various (admin) tools will be able to be put in as components.
            //  Could maybe make tools that use the API like a music file mixing tool, and would use the permissions API like an admin tool.
            //   Would be able to save created files / sequences to the server.
