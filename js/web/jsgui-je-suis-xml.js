// Je Suis XML.
// I am XML.

// Take an XML document
//  Maybe load it
//  Maybe obtain it from the DB.

// Create the various components.
//  This will be a templating engine, kind of.

// Go through the XML document, looking for what is not HTML, or what is the JSUI markup.
//  These objects will be defined according to a namespace that it listens to.

// Name -> JSGUI Control.

// Could use more templating replacement rather than getting everything back from the XML DOM...
//  however, it would scan the template for the named items?
//   but would the items necessarily be named?
//   they would occurr in the same order, so that's not a problem.
//  Make the list of such items, and go through them sequentially.
//   Having the XML DOM aware of what character in the document the item is...
//    that seems like the most effective way of doing it.

// Using a parser that is not standard... that gives the character positions of every item.
//  That way, all controls can be initialized there.

// Control gets initialized, and put within the document.
//  New instance of the control for each rendering.

// Will have a system of cached renderings as well.

// System of cached renderings of controls
//  Controls with specific specs or parameter sets.
//  This caching system may be distributed accross the network.
//   Will be caching of various rendered units.
//   The cache will be an abstraction more complicated than a dict.
//   I think this could wind up being a lot like ASP.NET but potentially with even better performance?
//    Likely to be faster because of the non-blocking way of node.js.
//   This would be a good benchmark to see, app could be similar in structure and complexity to an ASP.NET site.
//    Though 'website' is just one abstraction within the system really. Could be more flexible than ASP.NET. The wiring is there, but in a different form.
//     Not so much part of a closed, compiled framework, but is the app that gets run by node.js.

// I think the (network / resource) caching system will be very useful for the 'je suis' implementation.
//  Je suis should also work using JSON.
//  I think an XML variant is very suitable here because of the similarity to HTML and ASP.NET.

// There may be different optimization processes for this.

// Take XML document
//  Identify the active nodes, acrtive nodes get processed on the server.

// Parsing and returning whole document as XML makes the most sense.

// Then go through the tree, turning the active items into controls.
//  Equivalence of runat="server"?
//   I think I will allow runat="server" attributes on HTML elements too.
//   Want to make it compatible with ASP.NET where appropriate.
// The items that get run at the server will need an ID.
//  They will be able to be referred to within a block of server-side code.
//  Hopefully developers will find this system very useful indeed.
//   It will be interesting to see the performance comparison between this and ASP.NET
//   I may make this follow ASP.NET in other situations too, possibly I could make an ASP.NET compatibility layer.
// Mainly I want this to be using familiar development methodologies to ASP.NET.

// Needs to turn an XML document into the rendered page, possibly including more JavaScript as well.
//  There could be a fairly simple JavaScript page that runs on the server and is associated with the page.
//  There is not the session state on the server, so there is much less to do.
//  Not really sure where the server-side JavaScript for the page would fit in.
//   The components are generated using JavaScript, and they take various parameters.
//    Much of the interactions will take place on the client-side. This provides a means to use declaritive instanciation of
//    controls.

// Need to transform the document to controls.
//  Not sure about making loads of things as HTML controls.

// Maybe putting controls in where appropriate.
//  We'll still have an XML document, keeping some things just as the provided html text?
//  I do quite like the idea of having this XML / text not processed, and just returned.
//  Splitting up the XML text as a string processing task? Identifying which XML nodes are active?
//   I think the performance will be much better if the whole page does not go through the Controls system.
//   Only want those particular controls to be activated.
//    May also be best not parsing the whole document into an XML DOM, but just searching for the controls that get activated.

// The controls will be showing different things in different contexts.
//  A main one is the user that is logged in. A file manager control would be for managing the files appropriate to that user.

// This will be useful in developing pages quickly that use particular controls in the context of a page.
//  The idea is that a simple HTML server can be running, using an existing HTML website.
//  After that, some HTML is replaced with jsgui Controls.

// It then gets served.
//  Tree containing both XML nodes and JSGUI controls.
// Could possibly turn the whole HTML into an active document as well.
//  That could be useful for some things, like editing the whole document on the client.

// I think only activating pieces of it makes the most sense.
//  Master pages in ASP.NET are very important and useful.
//   Want there to be a similar system here.

// Master pages are effectively controls.
//  In this system, there is that further abstraction so that they don't necessarily get rendered as pages anyway, but that is really the main output of rendering
//  here anyway.

// Parsing whole XML document - does seem fairly important. Need to recognise things properly, looking for the correct attributes.
// Will have various parts cached and returned from the cache rather than re-rendered.

// The common elements could be put together very quickly.
//  Again, will investigate using the graphics card for rendering in the right context. Could program this on a lower level and have it work very quickly.

// Caching the rendered parts from inputs.
//  Seems best with rendered controls.
//  Want a system that discards things from the cache if they don't get used so often.
//  Want it so it shows the measurable speed-up. Could have different types of cache.
//  One such type is a network-memory type cache.
//   Hash quickly created out of control and its parameters. It will attempt to retrieve the required output from the cache.

// The actual rendering... XML/HTML will contain the important items.
//  Inside them, however, are JSGUI controls / controls XML. These make the thing that contains them non-standard.

// Shallow-mode controls
// Only have different segments.
// Can contain text (html) that gets output
// Can contain other controls.
// control.content?
//  rather than control.controls.
//  this makes sense, so that content can just be HTML.
//  The inner controls... there could be inner controls in different places.
//  Content may just be an array... this could make it run reasonably quickly.
//   May investigate using gfx card ram for this, but likely to have integrated cache of most frequently used rendered items.
//  For now, it makes sense to generalize controls.controls to controls.content.
//   If it is just a piece of text, not in an array, then the control should render just as that text.
//   But referring to the content... perhaps there could be inner_content. That could possibly be signified as another control, with a reference to that control.
//    A silent control - one that does not render its own markup. It is not a div with anything inside.
//    Tagless control is a less cool name (less ninja-like) but more descriptive so I'll go with it.


// This may work within the rendering / transformation framework.

// Have it as a single function?
//  Also with a page context and other output options.

// XML -> HTML and JavaScript properties.
//  Taking in page context information
//  Other information about objects in the XML could be given.

// With the JavaScript included in modules, a few properties for the objects could be set.
//  Also, data could be loaded through screen scraping facilities.

// Doing parsing, while retaining string references, and the replacing the XML components would make the most sense in terms of speed optimization.
//  Having this really fast from the beginning would be a big advantage.

// Does not look like SAX parsers necessarily provide the position.

// My own parser would do the trick - it does not have to be SAX exactly, but needs to return events about the locations of various items.
//  From the information returned, navigation would be possible, may require a few algorithms though.

// The main point will be in identifying the elements and items in the XML document, then these will be examined to see which of the items there are
//  either normal HTML or are JSGUI.

// Even normal HTML, with processing options and deployment targets set, may be rendered as shims and other things. It may refer to the CSS in order to do this,
//  seeing where necessary. May analyse the document looking for occurrances of certain things and changing them, or could re-render the whole document.

// Complete re-rendering mode... means all html elements will get recreated as controls.


// maybe should not need an instance of a class...

// just being functions that carry out the transformation.


// xml as string -> html as string, json object properties.

// Really want to be using a parser that identifies each object as it has occured.
//  I think it may be a SAX parser.
//  Does not build the DOM tree, but provides references to the positions in the string for where the nodes occurr.
// With the beginning and ending positions of all items noted, it will be possible to go through them (the nodes)
//  identifying which are html and which are JSGUI.
// The JSGUI nodes could be identified like <JSGUI:ColorPicker>, but would want <colorpicker> with the right API to work.

// Would refer to some aliases, but would also be checking the full namespaced names.

//  This would be as though HTML gets extended with other controls and components that raise JavaScript events in easy-to-handle ways.

// Positional parser - maybe this will not do tokenizing in the same way.
//  Perhaps I have a different parsing mechanism in mind to normal if obtaining references to the positions in the document is the goal.

// This whole system should enable some very advanced interfaces that are very easy to program - as if companies can have and use their own HTML components
//  in the websites they are making. It may wind up more developer-friendly than ASP.NET even.

// Controls will go through a composition phase on the server - this will help in identifying which bits of code can just be copied verbatim
//  and which get interpreted as jsgui controls.
//  Controls could contain some plain HTML - I'm not sure about that.
//   It may be best to fully parse the XML in controls into a DOM. They will only have a few parameters to begin with, but controls can contain HTML, and they can contain
//   other controls. System will be able to handle both ways.

// Jsgui / Je Suis XML needs to conform to the XML standard - XHTML with extensions basically.







// SAX or similar does make the most sense here because we'll need the locations of the elements so that a new document can get spliced together.
//  It is only with some of the parsers that they give the locations?
// Not sure about using http://code.google.com/p/jssaxparser
//  The code looks far too big. Looks like a parser could be far smaller and do as much.
// I think we need a good JavaScript implementation of this parser...
//  but using the existing parser may be the best approach (perhaps with a wrapper) and then its implementation can be swapped should I have an improved one.
// My own parsing mechanism will probably be important for parsing (and modelling?) various coded documents that the user interacts with.

// Efficient parsing / interpretation of XML seems important here, this probably won't be needed (soon) in the client-side library, and would be fine (but not ideal) running on the server
//  as a large JavaScript file that does the job OK.

// My own JavaScript XML parser may be more suitable soon, it would not be very much code either.

// Index-based storage and retrieval in and XML document.
//  I think this may be a bit different, in full, to SAX, but the SAX events or SAX event methodology may play a part in creating the index.
